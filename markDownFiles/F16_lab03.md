Dong H. and Margaret S.
1. A gui version of the Chinese board game called Go.
2. As a player I can click a tile in the board and place a white or black piece. As a player I can press the direction button to pull up a page that displays how the game works. As a player I can hit the surrender button and end the game and let the other player win. As a player I can hit the skip turn button to pass my turn to the next player. As a player I can press the restart button to reset the game state to the beginning. 
3. The software does indeed run, as far as I can tell it runs smoothly but I have not attempted to break the code with intense work or processed the bugs that are noted. The software generates a Go board and allows players to take turns and play pieces.
4. As a user I should be able to click a button so that I can offer the other player a draw. As a user I should be able to click play and the game should have proper rounded tiles. As a user I should be able to click a end game button to end the game without winning, losing, or drawing.
5. The README.md is in good shape and there are plenty of details. It notes issues and tells future owners of this repo what is going on in each class and what everything does.
6. Javadoc looks like it has decent commenting and no code that needs removal. Some portions have comments to tell the user what is going on with the code, otherwise it could possibly use some more.
7. There look like plenty of smallish to medium issues. Some of the issues look like they could have better descriptions and some of them look done but are not removed. Otherwise I think it is doable to earn 1000 points in this.

9. The code looks pretty messy, it looks complicated but without a super deep look at how everything runs its hard to determine if the code is efficient. There are comments on some of the code that helps future programmers out with learning what the code does. Some portions could use more comments because they are kind of confusing to read. I wouldn't say there is one screenful of text available to get the viewer up to speed. Everything is divided in sections and the comments are not detailed enough to explain everything together.
10. There are no junit tests available in the project. It could use junit tests for everything in this project. I would completely rehaul the project to add junit tests for everything.
