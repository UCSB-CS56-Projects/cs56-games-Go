a. The project is making a game of GO that can be played with two human players.

b. As a player, I can click a tile and make it change color so that I can gain points. As a player, I can click the directions button so that I can learn how to play the game.

c. The software runs. You can click on a tile and that changes the tile's color. The captures work to a certain extent. Each move updates the score. There is a surrender button and a direction button. The direction button opens a new window that contains the directions to playing the game.

As a player, I would like a restart button so that I can play more than one game. As a player, I would like clearer colored grids so that empty tiles can be distinguished from tiles occupied by stones. As a player, I would like territory points to be counted so that the scoring system is more accurate. As a player I would like to place a stone is a tile without liberties if it results in a capture and no suicide so that it resembles the rules of the game more closely.

d. Some typos/misspellings. The README can be improved by including the directions text.

e. The build.xml file seems up-to-date. It does not have any old legacy JWS stuff and the targets have descriptions.

f. The issues are more than enough to earn 1000 points by working on this project. Go is a complex game and much of the code might have to be rewritten to perfectly match the rules of Go.

g. https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/18

h. The code is separated into the main code, the code for the grid shapes, the directions, etc. The method and variable names are reasonable. There are comments but more comments may be helpful. For example, in GoGrid.java, I do not understand why in the method toString(), gridLine is set to equal "-+-+-+-+..." I am unsure why there are .java~ files in addition to the .java files on github.

If I had to give a programmer one screenful of text, that text would contain a link to the instructions of Go and the file explanation that is in the README.md.

i. I don't think there are any jUnit tests. A test that can be added should test if the points match up correctly in a sample game of Go.
