Issues to work on:

* Issue: Implement either Area Scoring or Territory Scoring (500 points, but this is way hard and will probably be worth a lot more):
  	 LINK: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/7
	  It appears as though the scores of the two players is solely determined by the number of pieces they each have on the board as seen in getWinner() in GoGrid.java.
	  Fix this scoring system to use either Area Scoring or Territory scoring, both of which also take into account for a player the number of empty points only their stones surround.

	  Make sure the type of scoring used is consistent with the type of scoring discussed in the Directions Pop up.


* Issue: Implement the Ko Rule (200 points)
  	 LINK: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/28
	  -"Consequence (ko rule). One may not play in such a way as to recreate the board position following one's previous move". (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_go)

* Issue: Surrender vs End Game (100 points)
  	 LINK: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/29
	  Right now, the surrender button just ends the game and determine the winner based on the number of stones. Semantically, surrender means that a person gives up the win to the other player. The player who clicks the surrender button should lose and when the two players want to end the game, they should click the end game button instead.

* Issue: Game ends after 2 consecutive passes. (50 points)
  	 LINK: https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/30
     If both players pass, the game ends and the winner is determined by the number of stones. 


*Issue: The code is repetitive and needs to be fixed. (100 points)
