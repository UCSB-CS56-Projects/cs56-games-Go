Issues for the next class to work on:

[Issue #90](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/90): Make Single-Player and Two-Player consistent (200 points)  
Issue #91: Allow the player(s) to have multiple save files (100 points)  
Issue #92: (Mostly CSIL-specific) Sometimes, not all the Opening Screen buttons show up (100 points)  
Issue #93: Create a menu that allows the player to choose from a selection of music tracks (100 points)  

200 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 500 points
