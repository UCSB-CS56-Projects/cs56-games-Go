Issues for the next class to work on:

[Issue #90](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/90): Make Single-Player and Two-Player consistent (250 points)  
[Issue #91](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/91): Allow the player(s) to have multiple save files (150 points)  
[Issue #92](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/92): (Mostly CSIL-specific) Sometimes, not all the Opening Screen buttons show up (100 points)  
[Issue #93](https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-projects/cs56-games-Go/issues/93): Create a menu that allows the player to choose from a selection of music tracks (100 points)  

250 + 150 + 100 + 100 = 600 points
